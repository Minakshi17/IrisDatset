# IrisDatset
Scikit-learn challenge
In this challenge, you are required to use the iris dataset that comes with sklearn. After loading the dataset, carry out some exploration to identify what the dataset is about. Visualise the data using suitable plots. After that, use the following algorithms from sklearn library-
1.      K Nearest Neighbours
2.      LinearSVC
3.      Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes
4.      Logistic Regression
Split the dataset into training and testing, fit a model using the above algorithms on the training data and then perform predictions on the test data. Obtain the scores for each algorithm and analyze which algorithm gave the best results for this dataset.
Note- You are allowed to do any preprocessing you find relevant.
